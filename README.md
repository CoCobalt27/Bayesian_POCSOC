# A Bayesian inference approach to determine POC and SOC in PM2.5 using major species measurement data
- This repository gives a sample R script to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian inference in differentiate POC and SOC in ambient measurement data.
- A small real-world dataset made at Dianshan Lake air quality monitoring site in 2019 wintertime is also included.
